## Info
My default configs (for basic workplace setup) are [here](https://github.com/RayChimera/configs)

Coding stats are [here](https://codestats.net/users/chimera), they are auto-synced from VSCode (TL;DR CodeStats don't have access to the code you write, [only meta information about coding habits](https://codestats.net/tos))
